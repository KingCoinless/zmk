Note to user:

(1)	Peripheral RGB function is impaired until full support is implemented in the master branch.
(2)	OLED displays are not currently included in this shield. This will be updated after OLED support is live.
(3)	Definitions for 'KANA' and 'EISUU' input are currently utilized under 'LANG1' and 'LANG2' respectively.

Thanks to NiceII, KemoNine, PeteJohanson, TJ "Chormbo The Great", Joelspadin/Rinh, Wofiel, Okke,
and the rest of the ZMK contributors for their support in constructing this shield.
I appreciate your assistance greatly. This has been a valuable learning experience for me.
I hope this contribution serves the community well.
